    <h2><span class="section-icon">üî¨</span> Research Overview</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
    As a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://gdclifford.info/gari">Clifford Lab</a> at Emory University, my research focuses on developing novel AI-driven methods and sensing technologies to address critical challenges in healthcare, particularly for neurological and developmental disorders. My interdisciplinary approach combines expertise in artificial intelligence, biomedical sensing, and signal processing to create tools that can improve patient outcomes through early detection and personalized interventions.

      <h3>Research Focus Areas</h3>
      
      <div class="research-area">
        <h4><span class="area-icon">üß†</span> Novel Biomarkers for Neurological Disorders</h4>
        <p>Working with the <a href="https://empowerment.emory.edu">Cognitive Empowerment Program</a> and the <a href="https://alzheimers.emory.edu">Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research Center</a>, I develop methods to identify cognitive markers in older adults at risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment using multimodal data from wearable technologies, including <a href="https://www.nextsense.io">NextSense in-ear EEG devices</a> and wristband health monitors.</p>

      <div class="research-area">
        <h4><span class="area-icon">üîê</span> Privacy-Preserving Sensing for Neurodevelopmental Disorders</h4>
        <p>In collaboration with <a href="https://thecenterfordiscovery.org">The Center for Discovery</a>, I am researching the relationship between sleep patterns and behavioral outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder. This work involves building an end-to-end edge computing system using off-body sensors that prioritizes privacy while extracting meaningful behavioral insights.</p>

      <div class="research-area">
        <h4><span class="area-icon">üìä</span> AI-Driven Pattern Recognition for Health Monitoring</h4>
        <p>Building on my PhD research in knowledge discovery at Georgia Tech, I develop interpretable machine learning models for biomedical applications. This includes work on the <a href="https://moody-challenge.physionet.org/2022/">George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge</a>, co-organizing a challenge with over 80 participants on heart murmur detection from phonocardiogram recordings.</p>

    <p>Before joining Emory, I completed my PhD at Georgia Tech (2016-2021) where I focused on machine learning-assisted optimization and knowledge discovery in nanophotonics. My doctoral research developed new approaches using deep learning, manifold learning, and dimensionality reduction to better understand light-matter interactions.</p>
