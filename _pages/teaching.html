  <div class="philosophy-section">
    <p>
      My teaching approach combines theoretical foundations with practical, hands-on experience. I believe in creating
      an inclusive learning environment that encourages critical thinking and collaborative problem-solving.
      In my teaching, I emphasize the ethical implications of technology in healthcare and the importance of
      developing solutions that address real-world challenges while respecting privacy and promoting equity.
